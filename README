To set up compiler(e.g. ifort),
$ make ifort

*** complie
$ make atm
*** excute
$ ./atm

This repository is for constructing Gold (Au) psedo-potential

xion_0_test folder is to test xion = 0 case

########### 5D folders:
5D_run folder: change ref, rus for 5d orbitals, and run
5D_figures: wavefunctions and logarithmic derivatives for 5D orbitals, the title of each figure indicates the ref and rus used for this plot

############ (6S folders are under construction)
6S_run folder: change ref, rus for 6s orbitals, and run
6S_figures: wavefunctions and logarithmic derivatives for 6S orbitals, the title of each figure indicates the ref and rus used for this plot

############ (6P folders are under construction)
6P_run folder: change ref, rus for 6p orbitals, and run
6P_figures: wavefunctions and logarithmic derivatives for 6P orbitals, the title of each figure indicates the ref and rus used for this plot
